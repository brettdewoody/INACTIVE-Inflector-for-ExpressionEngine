Provides several functions to change words to plural, singular, camel case, etc.
This plugin is based on CodeIgniter's Inflector helper.
(http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/helpers/inflector_helper.html)

There are 5 functions:

{exp:eehive_inflector:singular}
Changes a plural word to singular.

{exp:eehive_inflector:plural}
Changes a singular word to plural.

{exp:eehive_inflector:camelize}
Changes a string of words separated by spaces or underscores to camel case.

{exp:eehive_inflector:underscore}
Takes multiple words separated by spaces and underscores them.

{exp:eehive_inflector:humanize}
Takes multiple words separated by underscores and adds spaces between them.

To use the functions above simply wrap your text in the appropriate
tag. Like this:

{exp:eehive_inflector:singular}Your contents{/exp:eehive_inflector:singular}

The above would singularize "Your contents" and return "your content".
